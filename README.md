# SpaceTraders
Space Traders Multiplayer Game

This code is written with the API's from https://spacetraders.io/
I'm not a programmer (as you will see with this code) :) 

It's completely written in BASH shell. In my case in OSX. 
You need 'jq' (Jason Query). Jq can be installed with for example 'brew'.
